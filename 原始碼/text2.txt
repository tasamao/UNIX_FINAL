SAS is a leader in business analytics.
Through innovative analytics it caters to business intelligence and data management software and services.
SAS transforms data into insight which can give a fresh perspective on business.
Unlike other BI tools available in the market, SAS takes an extensive programming approach to data transformation and analysis rather than a pure drag drop and connect approach.
That makes it stand out from the crowd as it gives much finer control over data manipulation.
SAS has a very large number of components customized for specific industries and data analysis tasks.
